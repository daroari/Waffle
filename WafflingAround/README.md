We created a new selection of the data, removing slavery details. (Above our pay grade).

We created a multibar plot next of the divorce rate per 1000 on the vertical axis and state on the horizontal axis.

We then assigned by hand each of the states to a new borader category of region to be able to make a bar graph that has a bar for divorce rate, marriage rate, and waffle house number.

We used the function ifelse()
